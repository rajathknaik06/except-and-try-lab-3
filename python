""" Rohan is working on a program to calculate the total expenses from a list of transactions. He inputs the number of transactions, N, and their respective values. However, he wants the program to handle situations where fewer than N values are entered. If this happens, the program should display a "list index out of range" message using exception handling.

Input format :
The first line of input contains a number of values N

The second line of input contains space-separated values

Output format :
The output displays the sum of the N values.

If the number of values is less than N, then it displays an IndexError message.
